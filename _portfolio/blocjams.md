To return to my programming roots I enrolled in Bloc's Web Development program.  One of our projects was to develop BlocJams.  BlocJams was a project using the HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript I learned in the first phase of the program.  During the coding of BlocJams I learned Dom Scripting and jQuery.  BlocJams was designed by Bloc.  It was my first project and it helped me learn frontend development.
