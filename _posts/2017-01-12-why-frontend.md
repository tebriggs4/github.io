title: Why did I decide to become a Frontend Developer?
---

I graduated from college with a degree in computer science.  I loved being a programmer.  I enjoyed writing code, testing code, documenting code,...  Then my husband and I decided to start a family and I became a stay-at-home mom for 10 years.

When I decided to return to the work field on a part-time basis, programming had passed me by.  So I decided to go into bookkeeping and accounting which was my minor work in college.  Recently I decided I really wanted to get back into programming.  I found Bloc's program online and decided their part-time web development class was for me!  I am very excited to be starting this program.  I am 20% of the way through and have a long way to go.  This has brought back my love for coding and problem solving.  I am right where I need to be!  Thank you Bloc!
